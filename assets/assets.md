# Assets

This file will cover the naming of images for the slideshow section

1. I suggest naming of images should folow the standard set previously: image(number).png
2. start indexing images at 0 is recommended 
3. .png file format is suggested
4. Less than 10 images is preferred
5. crop images to the standard 3:2 landscape position. This is highly recommended as otherwise it will create jumpiness on the page.
6. if deleting an image, make sure to not delete the favicon.ico or the logo.png from the assets folder.
